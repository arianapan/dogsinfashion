-- Defer profile creation until the user's email is actually confirmed.
--
-- Problem: previously, `handle_new_user` fired on `AFTER INSERT ON auth.users`,
-- which runs as soon as someone calls supabase.auth.signUp(). A user who
-- typos their email (e.g. `12345@163.cpm` instead of `.com`) will still
-- have a `public.profiles` row created for them, even though they can
-- never confirm and can never log in. Over time this leaves orphaned
-- profile rows that cannot be cleaned up automatically, and makes the
-- profiles table not a reliable "this user is real" signal.
--
-- Fix: move the trigger to fire on `INSERT OR UPDATE OF email_confirmed_at`,
-- and only insert the profile when `email_confirmed_at` is (or just became)
-- NOT NULL. This covers three flows:
--   1. Email/password signup with confirmation enabled:
--      INSERT with email_confirmed_at=NULL -> no profile yet.
--      User clicks confirmation link -> UPDATE sets email_confirmed_at
--      -> trigger fires -> profile created.
--   2. Google OAuth (and any provider that returns a pre-verified email):
--      Supabase inserts the auth.users row with email_confirmed_at already
--      set, so the INSERT branch fires and the profile is created.
--   3. Admin manually confirms a user in the Supabase dashboard:
--      UPDATE transitions email_confirmed_at from NULL to NOT NULL -> fires.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. Only affects the trigger definition; no data
-- is migrated. Existing profiles are untouched.
--
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor ONCE. Takes ~1 second. No redeploy needed.
